                    <p> My name is Chris Raptopoulos, and I am a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley where I will be studying a Master in Information Management & Systems with a focus on AI/ML and algorithm fairness. It is an interdisciplinary ~50 person, two year on-campus program that includes students from various backgrounds â€“ from software engineering to consulting. </p>

                    <p> Professionally, I have close  7 years in management consulting experience, recently at Roland Berger for private equity due diligence and operations strategy. I also spent over 5 years at Accenture, starting as an analyst and ending as an engagement manager. I also did a venture capital internship at Amplify Capital in Toronto's MaRS innovation ecosystem this past spring before I moved for my studies. </p>

                    <p> I played a lot of Baseball growing up. I played in the Canadian system, from Erindale Little League, to the Mississauga Majors AAA, to the Ontario Blue Jays (which has produced many big league talents including some I played with: our Jordan Romano and Cleveland's Josh Naylor), then finished on my undergrad college team as a shortstop and second baseman. </p>

                    <p> Beyond this, I love hanging with friends and family as much as I possibily can. </p>
